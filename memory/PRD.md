# PRD — ¿Quién va?

## Problem statement (original)
Mobile-first PWA "¿Quién va?" for youth (16-25) in Palma de Mallorca to decide weekend plans by seeing nightlife events and, crucially, which of their friends are attending each one. The differentiator is the social layer: who of your circle is going where. Not competing on catalog size.

## User personas
- **Joven asistente**: browses the feed, marks Voy/Me interesa, adds friends, checks who's going.
- **Admin (founder)**: single admin account, manages events via admin panel.

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI (`/app/backend/server.py`), MongoDB (motor). Auth via unified `session_token` (httpOnly cookie + Bearer). Object storage for image uploads (Emergent objstore).
- Frontend: React 19 + react-router + react-query + framer-motion + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Mobile-first, dark "Electric & Neon" theme (Unbounded + Outfit fonts).
- Collections: users, sessions, friendships, events, interests, notifications, files.

## Integrations
- Emergent Google OAuth (social login) + email/password (bcrypt) — coexist via session_token.
- Emergent Object Storage (event images, avatars).

## Core requirements (static)
1. Registration/profile (name, photo, city); Google + email; logout. ✅
2. Friends: search by username, requests, accept, list. ✅
3. Admin panel CRUD events (name, venue, address, date, time, image, genre, commission flag+url / more-info url). ✅
4. Feed sorted by date, filters by date (hoy/finde/semana) + genre. ✅
5. CORE: Voy / Me interesa exclusive toggle; friend avatars + aggregate text; empty state. ✅
6. Action button: Conseguir entrada (commission) / Más información. ✅
7. In-app notifications (bell) on friend "Voy" + friend requests/accepts. ✅ (weekly digest scheduler deferred)
- Privacy: interests visible only to accepted friends. ✅

## Implemented (2026-07-30)
- Full auth (email/password + Google OAuth callback), admin seed (admin@quienva.app).
- Friends flow, events feed + filters, Voy/Me interesa core with social proof + privacy.
- Admin CRUD + image upload, avatar upload, in-app notifications with unread badge.
- Seeded 6 sample Palma events. Verified: 16/16 backend tests, ~95% frontend flows.
