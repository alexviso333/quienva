# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Iteración importante del app "¿Quién va?" (Palma). Quiero (1) que el botón Google login siga
  visible pero funcione bien (pendiente credenciales), (2) racha destacada en el feed (no solo
  finde, también días y semanas seguidas), (3) sistema masivo de insignias con puntos por cada
  una, visibles en perfil propio y de amigos, (4) sistema de puntos con acciones (voy, estuve,
  amigo, story, referido, entrada, captura), (5) ranking amigos/ciudad/mundial, (6) chat entre
  amigos (DMs) + creación y chat de grupos de amigos (reemplaza el chat de evento), (7) álbum
  compartido de fotos y vídeos por evento (los asistentes suben, todos los amigos ven),
  (8) "capturas del momento" durante la fiesta (estilo BeReal pero propio) con puntos si es a
  tiempo, (9) calendario retrospectivo con multimedia agrupado por día, (10) panel admin
  avanzado con estadísticas, gestión de usuarios/eventos/tickets, (11) sistema de referidos con
  código único y puntos para ambas partes.

      BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - Iteration 8 NEW endpoints tested.
      
      TEST RESULTS: 50 PASSED / 4 FAILED (92.6% pass rate)
      
      ✅ WORKING ENDPOINTS (9/12 major features):
      - Rankings (friends/city/world) - all working
      - Referral system - core functionality working
      - Groups CRUD + chat - all features working
      - Moment capture - all features working
      - Calendar - all features working
      - Tickets tracking - all features working
      - Admin dashboard - all features working
      - Streak-full - working
      - Extended stats & badges awarding - working
      
      ❌ CRITICAL BUGS FOUND (3):
      
      1. BADGES - Authorization bypass (HIGH PRIORITY)
         Endpoint: GET /users/{user_id}/badges
         Issue: Returns 200 for non-friends instead of 403
         Impact: Privacy violation - anyone can view anyone's badges
         Location: backend/server.py line ~1230 (user_badges function)
         Fix needed: Add friendship check before returning badge data
      
      2. DM - Text length validation missing (HIGH PRIORITY)
         Endpoint: POST /dm/send
         Issue: Accepts messages >1000 characters (should return 400)
         Impact: Database pollution, potential performance issues
         Evidence: Found 1001-char message in database
         Location: backend/server.py line ~2428 (send_dm function)
         Fix needed: Add text length validation (1-1000 chars)
      
      3. ALBUM - Delete authorization bypass (HIGH PRIORITY)
         Endpoint: DELETE /events/{id}/album/{upload_id}
         Issue: Returns 200 when non-owner deletes upload (should return 403)
         Impact: Security vulnerability - users can delete others' uploads
         Location: backend/server.py line ~2728 (album_delete function)
         Fix needed: Add ownership check before deletion
      
      MINOR ISSUES (not blocking):
      - DM threads response uses 'user' field (test expected 'other_user') - API inconsistency
      - Invalid referral code returns 400 instead of 404 - acceptable
      
      All other functionality tested and working correctly. Test file created at /app/backend/tests/test_iteration8.py with comprehensive coverage of all new endpoints.
